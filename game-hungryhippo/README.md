Extremely Hungry Hungry Hippos
==============================

The game.

Compilation
-----------
If you're on Windows, then I can't help you. Otherwise, install the dependencies
that won't be documented here anytime soon and then run

    make

The program will be installed to `bin/main` relative to the project root.

Usage
-----
See `bin/main --help` for information about how to run the program and play the
game. Note that you *must* run the program from the project root, in order for
static resources to be found. If you get "No such file or directory" or
"IMG_Load: Couldn't open..." errors, then you're likely running the program from
the wrong location.

Credits
-------
This game was developed by Alex Burr, Gabe Fabre, Halle Blend, and Noah Ortiz as
part of Caltech's CS 3 course. They thank Adam Blank and the TAs for their
support.
