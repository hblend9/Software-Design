HOW TO PLAY EXTREMELY HUNGRY HUNGRY HIPPOS, THE GAME
    This is a round-based version of hungry hungry hippos, with powerups. The
    premise is that you are a hippo who must consume balls (some of which have
    powers) to satiate your extreme hunger. The reason you are so hungry is
    because you are bad at eating.

    Each round ends when all the balls have been consumed. The player who got
    the most points that round is eliminated, and the remaining players progress
    until there is one player left.

    You can view your points and a cryptic description of your currently
    selected powerup, as well as how many powerups you have. You'll have to
    play for yourself to get a sense of what these descriptions mean.

    To be a hippo, refer to the table of key controls below. Hint: connect
    multiple keyboards for maximum players and maximum fun. In the table, CW and
    CCW mean to move clockwise and anticlockwise around the pond respectively;
    EAT means to elongate your hippo neck for consumption; ACTIVATE means to
    activate your currently selected powerup; and SWITCH means to change your
    currently selected powerup to the next one in your list.
